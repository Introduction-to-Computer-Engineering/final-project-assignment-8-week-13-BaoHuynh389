          #Week 13 - Oscilloscopes and serial protocols
 ##Part 1: Oscilloscope warmup:
         - Watch the first 4 oscilloscope videos referenced below.
         - Take a look at the Rigol 1000 Series oscilloscopes documentation site to see what resources you have               in case you need mmore in-depth knowledge.
         The oscilloscope shows continuous varying signals that it detects at the tips of its probes. The probe                 has a two wires: signal (red or central probe), and ground (black or outside wire). Remember                     that voltage is a relative potential, so, unless you connect the ground, which serves as the reference level, you will get garbage.
         Connect a Rigol probe to Channel 1.
         
 ##Part 2: Visualize simple continuous signals:
   i:Visualize the following signals, using the Auto regime and default settings (trigger on a rising edge on CH1). For each signal, take a video of the setup (the source wire and connection of the oscilloscope probe) and the display of the oscilloscope, while varying one of the signal properties (wave shape, frequency, amplitude) using the controls of the source. *(LINK FILES)
